#Exercise-1 <br />
Install any dependencies you need and write a start script for your server. Build out your express server and route your requests (GET, POST, DELETE) to your controller. Controller functionality can be merely a console.log at this point. Make sure that your requests are hitting your endpoints.

#Exercise-2 <br />
Create an index.js file in your database directory. Inside of that file, use sequelize to establish a connection to your mysql database.
Export your connection.

#Exercise-3 <br />
Create a models.js file inside your database directory. Inside of that file, construct your schemas and export those schemas.

#Exercise-4 <br />
Inside of your controller.js, import your database models and build out your controller functions.
